How to Play

Welcome to Mariosweeper!

You will be playing as Boo from the Mario Franchise and your objective is to collect as many coins as possible across the field in the least amount of time.

However, mines, disguised as coins, are scattered across the field! If you collect a mine by mistake, it is GAME OVER...
You are given [flags] to place to note where you think mines are too.

What's more, Mario is here too! Because of your shy personality, when Mario is facing you, you have to hide. You will lose coins continuously until you hide.
